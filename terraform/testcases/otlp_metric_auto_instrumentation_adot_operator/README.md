This testcase validates metrics emitted using java-auto-instrumentation deployed through Opentelemetry-Operator. This test uses the ADOT java-auto-instrumentation image to instrument a Spark sample-app image (without java-agent baked in) using the OpenTelemetry Operator. The OpenTelemetry Operator also deploys and manages the ADOT collector. The validation and other functionality is similar to otlp_metric_adot_operator testcase.
