# run mock test

### Steps

1. Clone repos

Clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework.git
```

Clone the AWS OpenTelemetry Collector repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:aws-observability/aws-otel-collector.git
```

2. Install Terraform

```
Install Terraform: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli
```

3. Install Docker compose

```
Install Docker compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
```

4. Run one of the test cases:

```
cd aws-otel-test-framework/terraform/mock
terraform init
terraform apply -var="testcase=../testcases/otlp_mock" -var-file=../testcases/otlp_mock/parameters.tfvars
terraform destroy
```

*hint: this test might take 20 minutes as it builds the image of collector in place.*

### Explain the test

This test runs fours containers: 
1. Sample app container
2. Collector container
3. Mock server container
4. Validator container. 

as per showing in the diagram. 

![logic diagram](https://testing-framework-artifacts.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mock.png)

Validator container calls sample app container so that it generate metric/trace to collector, then collector sends data to the mock server.
Validator then calls mock server to check if it receives data from collector. there's no data accuracy checking.

You can find a `docker_compose.yml` file, which is generated by the test, runs three containers including sample app, collector and mock server.
Validator container is started [here](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-test-framework/blob/terraform/terraform/mock/main.tf#L89), and fails the terraform process if the conainer exit with 1.

### Debugging

If the test fails, 

you can try to list the containers by using

```
docker ps
```

the output will be 

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES

db75def68bb0        mock_mocked-server      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   36 seconds ago      Up 34 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->8080/tcp     mock_mocked-server_1
```

then you can try to get logs for each containers. For example.

```
docker logs -f mock_aws-ot-collector_1
```
